#### **Step 2 - Find your North Star**
*(From Ali Abdaal)*
I like to think of life as a journey. You can choose to go anywhere, but it’s useful to identify where your personal _North Star_ is so that you know roughly what direction you want to travel. Your _North Star_ is entirely personal to you, and so we aim to find it through (surprise!) more structured journaling and reflection prompts. Here’s a flavour of some of my favourite prompts to help figure out roughly where my North Star is.

- 💭 **The Talent Service Prompt**: If you had all the money and time in the world, how would you use your talents to serve others?
- 🎤 **The Future TED Talk Prompt**: You’re attending the TED conference, and everyone in the audience (including you) is deeply moved and inspired by what the speaker is talking about. The speaker is you, 20 years in the future. What is “You + 20 Years” talking about, and what’s so inspiring about it?
- 🚀 **The Fearless Dream Prompt**: What would you like to do, if you knew you couldn’t fail?
- 🤷 **The Fail-Proof Dream Prompt**: What would you like to do, even if you knew you’d fail at it?
- 🌅 **The Ideal Tuesday Prompt**: What does your ideal ordinary Tuesday look like? What are you doing? Who are you with? How are you spending your time? What makes this day perfect for you?
- 🌠 **The Deferred Dream Prompt**: What’s one dream you’ve always had but never pursued? Why is it a dream for you? What’s stopped you from pursuing it?
- 💖 **The Role Model Prompt**: Who are the people you most admire, and why? What qualities do they possess that you wish to emulate?
- 🌍 **The Change Maker Prompt**: If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be and why? How could you contribute to this change?
- 🌟 **The Future Self Prompt**: Imagine you’ve achieved everything you’ve ever wanted. How have you changed as a person? What qualities and achievements define this future version of yourself?
- ✍️ **The Obituary Writing Prompt**: What do you want your obituary to say? Write it out.
- ⚰️ **The Tombstone Message Prompt**: What would you like written on your tombstone? It has to be under 280 characters to fit 😛

#### **Step 3 - Decide on your 2024 Goals**

The method here involves (1) divergent thinking to list out a bunch of different _dreams_ that you want, or might want, to pursue. And then once you’ve done that, (2) convergent thinking to narrow them down to specific _goals_ you’d like to focus on in 2024.
